/* Lesson 4: Advanced Borrowing and Reference Traits in Rust */
/* Note: lesson 4 and forward are under active development   */
/*       large reorganizations should be expected            */
/*************************************************************/

/// In this lesson, we will delve into advanced concepts related to borrowing and references in Rust.
/// We'll explore traits such as AsRef, AsMut, Deref, and DerefMut, which provide powerful ways to
/// work with references in a flexible and idiomatic manner. We'll also introduce smart pointers like
/// Ref and RefMut from the RefCell type, enabling interior mutability and dynamic borrow checking.
/// Additionally, we'll cover the Self keyword and lifetime specifiers ('a), which are essential for
/// writing generic and reusable Rust code. Understanding these advanced borrowing and reference traits
/// will equip you with the skills to write more efficient, safe, and idiomatic Rust programs.

/*   Vocabulary     */
/********************/

/// Self:     A keyword that refers to the current type or instance of a type.
/// 'a:       A lifetime specifier that indicates the lifetime of a reference.
/// AsRef:    A trait that allows for cheap reference-to-reference conversions.
/// AsMut:    A trait that allows for cheap mutable reference-to-mutable reference conversions.
/// Deref:    A trait that allows for implicit dereferencing of a value.
/// DerefMut: A trait that allows for implicit mutable dereferencing of a value.
/// Ref:      A smart pointer to a value that is borrowed.
/// RefMut:   A smart pointer to a value that is mutably borrowed.

Suggestions: This lesson might be challenging for beginners. Itâ€™s important to ensure
that you are comfortable with the earlier concepts before diving into this lesson.
